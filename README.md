Google Container Engine for Mattermost in production

## Requirement

* [Google Cloud plaform Account]

## Howto

### Install SSL certificate

You must install SSL certificate before starting. Put your SSL certificate as
`web/cert/cert.pem` and the private key that has no password as
`web/cert/private/key-no-password.pem`.

If you don't have them you can generate a self-signed SSL certificate.

### (Re)start

1. Run `docker-compose up -d`.
2. Open `https://your.domain` with your web browser.

### Stop

Run `docker-compose stop`.

### Remove the containers

Run `docker-compose stop && docker-compose rm`.

### Remove the data and settings of your mattermost instance

Remove `volumes` directory

## Known Issues

* Do not modify the Listen Address in Service Settings.
* Rarely 'app' container fails to start because of "connection refused" to
  database. Workaround: Restart the container.
